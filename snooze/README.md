# Phase2-Project 


# Project Goals:

1. You must make a single page application (only one index.html file) using create-react-app
2. Your app should use at least 5 components in a way that keeps your code well organized
3. There should be at least 3 client-side routes using react-routerLinks to an external site.
4. Use a json-server to create a RESTful API for your backend and make both a GET and a POST request to the json server. 
- Additionally, you may choose to incorporate data from an external API but it is not required.
- You should keep your json-server data simple: avoid nested data and associations. You'll learn how to work with more complex data in the next two phases. Focus on the frontend for this project.

# Name : Snooze
# Description

Snooze is an entertainment application that has a variety of Jokes.

# Get Data.
 Using an external API, I grabbed the data and put it in a db.json file. From which i fetched and rendered my data on to the website. 

# Components
Several Components came together to make the data on every page relevant and workable. The main components were :
- "Home"
- "Form"
- "Variety"

# Interactivity

As a user, you are able to add your own jokes onto the website and view them from the "Variety" page. 

As a user, you can shift from differnt views on the application depending on what you're looking for:
- For a preview of all the page entails, you can click "Home" on the navigation bar.
- To add you jokes on the application, you can click "Contribute"
- To see all the jokes on the application, you click "Variety".
